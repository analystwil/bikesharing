## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to pitch the viability of a bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA. In my analysis I presented data from a thriving bike sharing company, Citi Bike in NYC. We take a look at this data to see if such program would be successful in Des Moines.

## Data provided will answer the questions below

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

The visualizations will show:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

# Checkout Times for Users

The graph displays the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. This graph can be filtered by hour.

# Checkout Times by Gender

The graph displays the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. This graph can be filtered by hour and gender.

Looking at both the checkout times for users and by gender you will see that Male riders are majority of the data trend. For peak trip duration Female riders are higher than Male riders.

# Trips by Weekday Per Hour

The graph displays the number of bike trips by weekdays for each hour of the day of the week as a heatmap.

# Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The graph displays the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of the day of the week as a heatmap. This heatmap can be filtered by gender.

We see that the most usage is between 6am - 9am & 4pm - 7pm during Monday - Friday. On the weekends the usage is evenly distributed. For Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri alot of Male subscribers use the bike share.

# User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The graph displays the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. This heatmap can only be filtered by user and gender. We see again that majority of the usage is from Male riders. 

## Summary: 

By going through this analysis I would want to look deeper into the data as regards to the cost to rent a bike, is the cost increased during rush hour. What type of marketing does the NYC Bike Share program present to riders. Possibly look at 6 months statistics instead of just one month. I would also look into is there enough smaller sized bikes to accommadate the females. 

I was able to conclude that males are the top customers for this service. I would need to take a look at the male/female population in Des Moines to gauge if this would be a great business for the area.
